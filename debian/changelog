encryptsync (0.1.15) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ JustOkaou ]

  * Fix postinst to deploy default config properly.
  * Fix project path in cli install command
  * Fix user interaction in clear cli command for encryptsync-clear service
  * Fix install error when using system mode with .deb by skipping redundant project copy to /usr/lib/encryptsync
  * Added `encryptsyncctl edit` command to open config.yaml in nano
  * Auto-copy of config.template.yaml to /etc/encryptsync/config.yaml on first install
  * Added support for controlling both main and clear systemd services via CLI, with color-coded status output.
  * Fix service status command to properly detect if the oneshot `encryptsync-clear` service is enabled for shutdown.
  * Add robust detection of systemd and OS to prevent invalid service setup on non-Linux systems.
  * Add check to skip service installation if already present, and minor install script refactor.
  * Fix default config copy to use dynamic project path instead of hardcoded /usr/lib/encryptsync/
  * Add logging support for systemd services and implement `--force` option to reinstall them via the CLI.
  * Add centralized logger with user/system-specific log path fallback and dual output (console + file).
